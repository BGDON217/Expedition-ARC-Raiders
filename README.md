# Expedition Reset – Expedition ARC Raiders Guide Hub

**Expedition Reset** is a small, unofficial guide hub focused entirely on  
**Expedition ARC Raiders** – the Expedition Project soft-reset system in *ARC Raiders*.

The goal of this project is simple:

> Help players understand what Expedition is, what they lose and keep,  
> when to reset, and when **not** to touch that button.

Live site: **https://expeditionreset.com**

## What is ARC Raiders?

[ARC Raiders](https://arcraiders.com/) is a co-op PvPvE extraction shooter from Embark Studios.  
Players leave the underground hub to raid a hostile surface, fight ARC machines and other raiders,  
and extract with whatever loot they manage to carry back.

The **Expedition Project** adds a long-term soft-reset loop on top of that core gameplay.

## What is “Expedition ARC Raiders”?

Inside ARC Raiders, the **Expedition Project** is a voluntary soft reset:

- You **choose** to send a raider on Expedition.  
- You **lose** most character-level progress (level, stash, items, blueprints, many upgrades).  
- You **keep** account-level progress (cosmetics, premium currency, Raider Tokens, unlocked zones, etc.).  
- You **gain** permanent account bonuses such as:
  - extra stash space  
  - progression buffs for the next cycle  
  - **bonus skill points** based on the value of your stash + wallet at departure  

The problem is:

- The game only explains Expedition briefly in the UI.  
- Exact details and trade-offs are easy to misunderstand.  
- Many players search for “expedition arc raiders”, “is Expedition worth it”, or  
  “what do I lose in Expedition” and only find scattered opinions.

**Expedition Reset** exists to make Expedition ARC Raiders easier to understand and plan around.

## Why this project exists

The Expedition system is powerful but confusing:

- It touches almost every progression system: skills, stash, blueprints, currencies, quests.  
- It runs on a long, multi-week cycle, so a bad reset decision can feel punishing.  
- Information is scattered across patch notes, Reddit threads, and short tooltips.

**Expedition Reset** aims to be:

- **Unofficial, player-focused**, and independent of any in-game monetization.  
- Centered on **clear trade-offs**: what you lose, what you keep, and who should wait.  
- A small, focused hub where players can make informed decisions about Expedition ARC Raiders  
  instead of guessing.

3. **Hardcore / long-session players**

SEO & content notes

This repository intentionally focuses on a single, narrow topic:
	•	The Expedition ARC Raiders soft-reset loop
	•	The Expedition Project, stash value, bonus skill points, and timing decisions

Content design principles:
	•	One main hub: /expedition-arc-raiders – “Complete Expedition ARC Raiders Guide Hub”.

	•	“what do I lose, keep & gain?”
	•	“is Expedition worth it?”
	•	“how to start Expedition?”
	•	“best time to start Expedition?”
	•	“Expedition FAQ”.

If you extend the project, it’s best to add new, focused pages under
/expedition-arc-raiders/... and keep them interlinked with the hub.
